    <p>As I look out of my window this morning, I see the landscape I have learned to love here on Rapa Nui, which is known in 
	some places by the name Easter Island. The grasses and shrubs are green, the sky is blue, and the old, now extinct volcanoes 
	rise up in the background.</p>
    <p>I am a bit sad knowing that this is my last week on the island. I have finished my field work and will be returning home. 
	Later today, I will take a walk through the hills and say good-bye to the moai that I have been studying for the past nine months. 
	Here is a picture of some of these massive statues.</p>
	<p>If you have been following my blog this year, then you know that the people of Rapa Nui carved these moai hundreds of years 
	ago. These impressive moai had been carved in a single quarry on the eastern part of the island. Some of them weighed thousands 
	of kilos, yet the people of Rapa Nui were able to move them to locations far away from the quarry without cranes or any heavy 
	equipment.</p>
	<p>For years, archeologists did not know how these massive statues were moved. It remained a mystery until the 1990s, when a 
	team of archeologists and residents of Rapa Nui demonstrated that the moai could have been transported and raised using ropes 
	made from plants and wooden rollers and tracks made from large trees that had once thrived on the island. The mystery of the 
	moai was solved</p>
	<p>Another mystery remained, however. What happened to these plants and large trees that had been used to move the moai? As I 
	said, when I look out of my window, I see grasses and shrubs and a small tree or two, but nothing that could have been used to 
	move these huge statues. It is a fascinating puzzle, one that I will explore in future posts and lectures. Until then, you may 
	wish to investigate the mystery yourself. I suggest you begin with a book called Collapse by Jared Diamond. This review of 
	Collapse is a good place to start.</p>
    <div class="comment"><strong>Traveler_14</strong> May 24, 4:31 p.m.<br> Hi Professor! I love following your work on Easter Island. I can't wait to check out Collapse!</div>
    <div class="comment"><strong>KB_Island</strong> May 25, 9:07 a.m.<br> I also love reading about your experiences on Easter Island, however, I think there is another 
	theory that should be considered. Check out this article: www.sciencenews.com/Polynesian_rats_Rapa_Nui</div>

    <div class="header">Review of Collapse</div>
     <p>Jared Diamond’s new book, Collapse, is a clear warning about the consequences of damaging our environment. In the book, the 
	 author describes several civilizations that collapsed because of the choices they made and their impact on the environment. One 
	 of the most disturbing examples in the book is Rapa Nui.</p>
    <p>According to the author, Rapa Nui was settled by Polynesians sometime after 700 CE. They developed a thriving society of, 
	perhaps, 15 000 people. They carved the moai, the famous statues, and used the natural resources available to them to move these 
	huge moai to different locations around the island. When the first Europeans landed on Rapa Nui in 1722, the moai were still there,
	but the trees were gone. The population was down to a few thousand people who were struggling to survive. Mr. Diamond writes that 
	the people of Rapa Nui cleared the land for farming and other purposes and that they over-hunted the numerous species of sea and 
	land birds that had lived on the island. He speculates that the dwindling natural resources led to civil wars and the collapse of 
	Rapa Nui’s society.</p>
    <p>The lesson of this wonderful but frightening book is that in the past, humans made the choice to destroy their environment by 
	cutting down all the trees and hunting animal species to extinction. Optimistically, the author points out, we can choose not to 
	make the same mistakes today. The book is written well and deserves to be read by anyone who is concerned about the environment</p>

    <div class="header">Did Polynesian Rats Destroy Rapa Nui’s Trees?</div>
    <h4>By Michael Kimball, Science Reporter</h4>
    <p>In 2005, Jared Diamond published Collapse. In the book, he described the human settlement of Rapa Nui (also called Easter Island).</p>
    <p>The book caused a huge controversy soon after its publication. Many scientists questioned Diamond’s theory of what happened on 
	Rapa Nui. They agreed that the huge trees had disappeared by the time Europeans first arrived on the island in the 18th century, 
	but they did not agree with Jared Diamond’s theory about the cause of the disappearance.</p>
    <p>Now, two scientists, Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, have published a new theory. They believe that the Polynesian rat ate the seeds 
	of the trees, preventing new ones from growing. The rat, they believe, was brought over either accidentally or purposefully on the 
	canoes that the first human settlers used to land on Rapa Nui.</p>
	<p>Studies have shown that a population of rats can double every 47 days. That’s a lot of rats to feed. To support their theory, 
	Lipo and Hunt point to the remains of palm nuts that show the gnaw marks made by rats. Of course, they acknowledge that humans did 
	play a role in the destruction of the forests of Rapa Nui. But they believe that the Polynesian rat was an even greater culprit among 
	a series of factors.</p>
